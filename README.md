## ERP/API Link Master (new)

This repository now includes an implementation of the "ERP & API Username Linking Master" feature which:

- Adds `erp_username` and `api_username` columns to `profiles` and creates `kbs_api_linkmaster` table via SQL migration at `supabase/migrations/20251229123000_create_kbs_api_linkmaster.sql`.
- Enforces numeric `apiusername`, uniqueness for active `erpusername` mappings, and a sync trigger that keeps the linkmaster table updated when employee (profiles) are inserted/updated.
- Adds `src/components/dashboard/ApiLinkMaster.tsx` and `src/hooks/useLinkMaster.ts` for the UI and data layer.
- Provides an optional server-side hook example at `server/hooks/syncProfileToLinkMaster.ts` and an admin API at `api/admin/linkmaster.ts` (requires SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY).

Follow the migration file to apply DB changes to your Supabase/Postgres instance and test with the checklist in the project notes.
